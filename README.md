- Implement classic diversity measures
- A DataFrame is being changed somewhere by changing a copy of a slice.
- Check TrueDiversity equation and validity in extreme cases, large alpha
- Behavior of Merge is not intuitive: what changes name? what changes id? What is deleted?
- Implement starting probability as input for random walks
- (Done) Create Links of inverse relation
- (Done) Delete link Groups
- (Done) Merge Link Groups
- (Done~) Create Link Group from procedure
- (Done) Tests HIN transformations
- Create runtime tests
- Create Link Group from recommendations
- Create GNN recommendations
