# HINPy (Heterogeneous Information Networks for Python)

A framework for the analysis of diversity of recommendations in Heterogeneous Information Networks for Python.





TODO:
- Introduce verbose options for diversity operations
- Check TrueDiversity: plots for growing alpha values
- Behavior of Merge is not intuitive: what changes name? what changes id? What is deleted?
- Implement starting probability as input for random walks
- RMSE cross-validation for PP
- Create runtime tests
- Create GNN recommendations
- Remove references to timestamps
- Add seen relation to random recommender

AR:
- Acc Metrics for PP and CB
- Test all RS
- Databases
- Adoption cycles
